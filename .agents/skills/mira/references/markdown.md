Mira renders Markdown at build time, so none of it costs the reader any JavaScript. It follows CommonMark with the GitHub extensions.

## Supported syntax

- Tables, strikethrough, task lists, and footnotes
- Heading ids with `{#custom-id}` after a heading
- Smart punctuation: straight quotes become curly, `--` becomes an en dash, `---` an em dash
- Raw HTML, passed through as written

## Headings

Every heading gets an id from its text, so `## Shared elements` links as `#shared-elements`. Repeated headings get `-1`, `-2`, and so on. Second and third level headings are collected into the page's `toc`, which this site shows as **On this page**.

## Code

Fenced code blocks are highlighted at build time into classes the theme colors:

````markdown
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Mira");
}
```
````

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello from Mira");
}
```

The language label shows in the block's corner. Mira understands the common languages, including Rust, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML, Markdown, Python, Go, and shell. A few names map to the closest grammar: `mira`, `svelte`, and `vue` highlight as HTML, and `ts`, `tsx`, and `jsx` as JavaScript. Unknown languages render as plain, escaped text.

## Callouts

Start a quote with a marker to make a callout:

```markdown
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information.
```

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information the reader should notice.

> [!TIP]
> A better way to do something.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Something the reader needs to know.

> [!WARNING]
> Something that needs attention right away.

> [!CAUTION]
> The risks of an action.

## Footnotes

Mira writes footnotes[^1] with links back to the text.

## Prose styles

Markdown pages are wrapped in `<article class="prose">`, which sets a readable measure, rhythm, and styles for lists, quotes, tables, code, and images. Add the class to any element in a component to get the same styles.
