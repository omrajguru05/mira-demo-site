Moving between pages animates by default. Mira uses the browser's cross document view transitions, so each page stays plain HTML and the animation costs no framework code.

## How it works

Every page opts in to view transitions. When the next page arrives, the 938 byte runtime picks a transition name and a direction and hands them to the browser, which animates from a snapshot of the old page to the new one.

Browsers without cross document view transitions navigate normally. Nothing breaks; the motion is an enhancement.

## Choosing a transition

Mira picks the first match:

1. A route pair in config that matches the navigation
2. The destination page's `transition` frontmatter
3. `transitions.default` in config, which is `fade` unless you change it

```json
{
  "transitions": {
    "default": "fade",
    "pairs": {
      "/posts/ -> /posts/*": "slide-up"
    }
  }
}
```

```

## Route pairs

A pair key is `"<from> -> <to>"`. Each side is an exact path such as `/posts/`, or a prefix ending in `*` such as `/posts/*`, which matches any path under it but not the prefix itself.

Navigating a pair in the opposite direction plays the transition backwards. With the pair above, opening a post slides up, and returning to the list, by link or by the back button, slides down.

## Built in transitions

| Name | Forward | Back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fade` | Crossfade | Crossfade |
| `slide-up` | New page rises in | Old page sinks out |
| `slide` | Pushes in from the right | Pulls in from the left |
| `none` | No animation | No animation |

## Direction

The runtime sets a second transition type, `forward` or `back`. Back is a history traversal to an earlier entry, or a pair navigated in reverse. Use both types in your own CSS.

## Custom transitions

A transition name is a view transition type, so you define your own in CSS:

```css
html:active-view-transition-type(zoom)::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation: 420ms var(--mira-spring) both zoom-in;
}
html:active-view-transition-type(zoom):active-view-transition-type(back)::view-transition-new(root) {
  animation-name: zoom-out;
}
@keyframes zoom-in { from { opacity: 0; transform: scale(0.96); } }
@keyframes zoom-out { from { opacity: 0; transform: scale(1.04); } }
```

Then use `transition: zoom` in frontmatter or a pair.

## Timing

Shared elements move with `--mira-spring` over 520ms. The page itself fades with `--mira-ease-out`. Change `--motion-morph` and `--motion-fast` in your theme to retune everything at once. See [Design tokens](/docs/design-tokens/).

## Accessibility

- **Reduced motion.** When the reader asks for reduced motion, shared elements jump into place and the page crossfades over 120ms.
- **Focus.** After a link navigation, focus moves to the new page's main heading without scrolling, so keyboard and screen reader users start at the new content. Back navigations and links to a `#hash` keep the browser's behavior.
- **Agents and automation.** Transitions are skipped when the browser reports automation or a crawler, so the DOM is stable for agents.

## Prefetching

Transitions only look good when the next page is ready. Mira prefetches links on hover and prerenders on press with Speculation Rules, and falls back to a prefetch on hover, touch, or focus in other browsers. See [Performance](/docs/performance/#prefetching).
